# PullToRefresh Events in Xamarin Pull To Refresh (SfPullToRefresh)

There are three built-in events in the PullToRefresh control namely:

1. `Pulling`
2. `Refreshing`
3. `Refreshed`

The `Pulling` event will be notified whenever the swipe gesture is started. This event will notify the listener each and every time until the refresh content height exceeds. When we release the gesture from pullable content, `Refreshing` event will be triggered. Now the refresh operation can be performed. Once the content is refreshed, we should set `SfPullToRefresh.IsRefreshing` to `false` to stop the animation. Once the animation is stopped the `Refreshed` event will be triggered to notify that the refreshing is completed. 

## Pulling

`Pulling` event is triggered whenever you start pulling down on the `PullableContent` with `PullingEventArgs` that contains the following properties

* **Cancel** - You can cancel the pulling action based on the `Progress` value.
* **Progress** - Gets the progress completion value.

  private void PullToRefresh_Pulling(object sender, PullingEventArgs args)
  {
    args.Cancel = false;
    var progress = args.Progress;
  }
{% endhighlight %}


{% endtabs %}

## Refreshing

`Refreshing` event is triggered once pointer is released. This event will occur till the `IsRefreshing` property is set as `false`.

{%highlight Xaml%}

    <syncfusion:SfPullToRefresh x:Name="pullToRefresh" Refreshing="PullToRefresh_Refreshing" />

{% highlight c# %}

    pullToRefresh.Refreshing += PullToRefresh_Refreshing;
   
    private async void PullToRefresh_Refreshing(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        pullToRefresh.IsRefreshing = true;
        await Task.Delay(2000);
        pullToRefresh.IsRefreshing = false;
    }
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Refreshed

`Refreshed` event is triggered once the `Refreshing` event is completed.

{% tabs %}


{%highlight Xaml%}

    <syncfusion:SfPullToRefresh x:Name=" pullToRefresh" Refreshed="PullToRefresh_Refreshed" />

{%endhighlight%}

{% highlight c# %}

    pullToRefresh.Refreshed += PullToRefresh_Refreshed;
    private void PullToRefresh_Refreshed(object sender , EventArgs args)
